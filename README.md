## About

The **COVID Gene Database** is an interactive platform designed to assist researchers, scientists, and healthcare professionals in exploring gene expression changes across different COVID-19 variants.

- Select a COVID-19 variant to **view its associated up-regulated (activated)** and **down-regulated (suppressed)** genes.
- **Compare multiple variants** to find **common genes**, helping identify shared biological mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.
- The data is sourced from **genetic studies and analyses** to provide insights into how COVID-19 affects gene expression across various strains.

This tool supports research into **genetic patterns** that could guide therapies, diagnostics, and a deeper understanding of COVID-19 at the molecular level.

## Features

- View **up-regulated and down-regulated genes** for each COVID-19 variant.
- **Find common genes** among multiple selected variants.
- **Data sourced from** Computational Genomics CoE (Centre of Excellence).
- Fully responsive for both **desktop and mobile** devices.
